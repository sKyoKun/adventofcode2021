# adventofcode2021

This repository contains all the code writter for https://adventofcode.com/2021. These are Christmas themed exercices that you can answer in any language. Mine is made in PHP/Symfony 

I try to be as clean as possible but sometimes time is leaving me no choice than "quick and dirty" (sorry !) 

Install the project : ```composer install```

Run the symfony server : ```symfony server:start``` or ```bin/console server:start```

Run the tests : ```vendor\bin\phpunit```
